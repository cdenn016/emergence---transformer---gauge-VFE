"""
Gradient System Adapter for Hierarchical Multi-Scale Systems

Provides a minimal adapter to make MultiScaleSystem compatible with
the gradient engine without re-initializing agent state.

This adapter:
- Exposes active agents as a flat list
- Provides spatial overlap information
- Computes transport operators between agents
- Preserves agent state (no re-initialization!)
