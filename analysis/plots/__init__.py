Analysis Plotting Modules
==========================

Specialized plotting functions for different types of analysis:
- energy: Energy component analysis
- fields: Spatial field visualizations (mu, Sigma, phi)
- support: Support and overlap analysis
- softmax: Softmax weights visualization
- mu_tracking: Mu center tracking over time
